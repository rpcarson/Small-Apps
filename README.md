# Small Apps

# Small Apps

This is a colleciton of smallish size apps that span from the beginning of my Swift experience until present.

They are presently in various states of completion and most represent the exploration of a new concept encountered during my iOS class at Iron Yard, summer cohort 2015. Over time most of these will be combed through, reviewed and brought to a state of completion in order to strengthen my code skills.
